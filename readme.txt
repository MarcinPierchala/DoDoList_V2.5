  
Hello,

V 2.4

this is a simple to-do list builder with determining the importance of the task, and with a countdown of days from the creation of the task.

in a simple console menu, you can choose:
>to create a job,
>delete a job, 
>view saved jobs,
>and close the program.

the file with tasks is in pickle format and it is saved locally on the machine, or it is created if not exist.

V 2.5 

the program, compared to the previous version, has been rebuilt into an object-oriented type.
 
The file containing the classes has been separated from the rest of the program code, and imported there as a module.

Thank You,

Martin
